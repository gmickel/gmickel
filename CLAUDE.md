# gmickel GitHub Profile

## Updating Projects Section

Style: steipete-style (emoji + bold link + dash + fun/punchy description)

### To refresh projects list:

1. Get all public repos: `gh repo list gmickel --public --limit 100 --json name,description,createdAt,pushedAt`
2. **2025+ repos** → Current Projects (unless it's a fork)
3. **Pre-2025 repos** → Legacy Work (except CodeWhisper which is special)
4. Read each repo's README for context before writing descriptions
5. Descriptions should be punchy, memorable, personality-driven

### CodeWhisper note:
Early attempt at CLI-based plan→implement AI agent. Still used daily for Repo Context gathering. Treat as "legacy but still relevant."

### Forks to exclude:
- osgrep (fork)
- evalite (fork)
- Any repo that's clearly a fork of another project

### Description style examples:
- "Most agent failures are process failures. Plan first, drift never."
- "Your local second brain. Hybrid search that actually finds things."
- "When Graph API is blocked, COM whispers to Classic Outlook."
- "AI clipboard carnage? Fixed. Ghost indentation, begone."
