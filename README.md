# Hi there, I'm Gordon üëã

Hello there! I'm Gordon, a software engineer specializing in full stack web development and AI engineering. Currently, I'm wearing several hats:

- Tech Lead @ [Cistec AG](https://www.cistec.com/):
  - Member of the internal enabling team of developers, facilitating the migration of our modules to a cutting-edge technology stack.
  - Spearheading our AI engineering initiatives, including the development of robust AI pipelines and the integration of generative AI technologies across our projects.
- Owner of [Mickel Tech](https://mickel.tech)
- Co-founder at [DocIQ](https://twitter.com/dociq_io)
- Technical Advisor for various projects

My recent passion lies in AI engineering, particularly in building with and on top of Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm deeply involved in exploring the potential of generative AI and its practical applications in enterprise settings.

Feel free to connect with me on Twitter to learn more about my work, our AI advancements at Cistec, and my thoughts on the evolving tech landscape!
