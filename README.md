# Hi there, I'm Gordon üëã

[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/gmickel?color=%234682B4&logo=twitter&style=for-the-badge)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgmickel&screen_name=gmickel)

I turn AI into repeatable value creation ‚Äî as a builder, operator, and trusted advisor. Full-stack engineer turned founder turned AI strategist, I ship production LLM platforms (0‚Üí1 in <90 days), enable engineering teams, and bridge the gap between technical possibility and business reality.

## üéØ Operating Modes

- **Builder:** Founded and sold AI LegalTech to Swiss enterprises (incl. Swisscom) via [DocIQ](https://twitter.com/dociq_io)
- **Operator:** Recently transformed KISIM (Switzerland's leading CIS) with AI-first capabilities at [Cistec AG](https://www.cistec.com/)
- **Technical Expert:** Engaged by top law firms for IP/copyright analysis and expert testimony
- **Advisor:** Guide VCs, C-suites, and portfolio companies on AI strategy, architecture, and risk via [Mickel Tech](https://mickel.tech)

## üöÄ What I Build

My work focuses on creating robust, production-ready AI systems that drive measurable business outcomes:

- **Reusable AI Platforms:** LLM API gateways, vector search services, RAG pipelines, evaluation frameworks
- **Privacy-Preserving AI:** On-prem PII masking (97%+ accuracy) for FADP/GDPR compliance in regulated environments
- **Agentic Architectures:** Multi-agent systems, prompt-to-structured-data compilers, semantic search at scale
- **Developer Enablement:** AI coding assistant rollouts, prompt engineering playbooks, safety guardrails
- **Production LLM Ops:** Evaluation pipelines (quality/safety/latency/cost), observability, A/B testing

## üí° Recent Wins

- Shipped production LLM platform in <3 months driving new ARR in Swiss hospitals
- Built reusable AI components adopted by 6+ internal teams
- Scaled GitHub Copilot/Cursor to 50+ engineers with measurable productivity gains
- Forged strategic partnerships (Google Cloud, research institutions)
- Speaker at openEHR.ch Symposium on "Agentic AI for Structured Clinical Data"

## üéØ 2025 Focus

- Exploring Operating Principal and Staff/Principal AI Engineering opportunities
- Building the next generation of agentic AI systems
- Advising select teams where deep technical execution meets strategic impact
- Open-source contributions to the AI engineering community
